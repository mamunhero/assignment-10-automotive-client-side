# Features
# Fetch Data:
 If you need to fetch data from an external source, you can use the useEffect hook to perform asynchronous operations. For example, if you want to load product data based on the brandname parameter, you can modify the existing useEffect:
 # Render Components: 
 You can render components and display data within your return statement. For example, if you want to display additional information based on the fetched data:
 # Context API:
 The useContext hook is used to access the AuthContext, which is likely a context provider for handling user authentication and state.
 # Form Handling: 
 The component handles form submission for user login. It collects user input for email and password, submits the data to an authentication function, and displays success or error messages using the Swal library.
 # Links and Navigation: 
  Links from React Router (Link component) are used to navigate between different pages, such as the "Register" page.

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.
